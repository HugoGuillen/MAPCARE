"1-20|Diagnostic measures: Examination of individual body systems: Neurological examinations|A series of tests and assessments conducted to evaluate the function of the nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves."
"1-202|Diagnostic measures: Examination of individual body systems: Neurological examinations: Diagnostics to determine irreversible brain function failure|A series of tests and assessments conducted to evaluate the functioning of the nervous system, specifically focusing on identifying permanent damage or loss of brain function."
"1-202.0|Diagnostic measures: Examination of individual body systems: Neurological examinations: Diagnostics to determine irreversible brain function failure: In a potential organ donor|A series of tests and evaluations conducted on the nervous system to assess the extent of brain damage and determine if there is irreversible brain death. This is crucial in the context of organ donation as it establishes whether the individual's brain has ceased functioning permanently, making them eligible for organ donation."
